Spring MVC:

Topic: Autowiring

1: byName - wires by the name(id) of the bean. The id and the name of the member variable defined in the class for which the bean is created should be same.
2: byType - wires by the class type. This works if there is only type of bean that needs to be wired. If there are multiple beans of the same class, spring would not understand which bean needs to be wired due to ambiguity.
3: constructor - Autowire by constructor is same as autowire by type, but instead of a setter injection it does a constructor injection.
4: default setting for autowiring is OFF 

in real world applications its very hard to biforcate between dependencies Autowire may fail in huge and bulky applications.
